          your private communications and other personally identifiable information

          to disclose information to the government, law enforcement agencies or third
          parties under certain circumstances, third parties may unlawfully intercept
          or access transmissions or private communications, or members may abuse or
          misuse your information that they collect from our Websites. Therefore,
          although we use industry standard practices to protect your privacy, we do
          not promise, and you should not expect, that your personally identifiable
          information or private communications will always remain private.

          As a matter of policy, we do not sell or rent any personally identifiable
          information about you to any third party. However, the following describes
          some of the ways that your personally identifiable information may be
          disclosed.

          Financial Information. Under some circumstances we may require some 
          additional information, such as, but not limited to credit card details.
          We use this financial information, including your name, address, and
          other information, as well as to bill you for use of our services. 
          We use your financial information to check your qualifications, to 
          bill you for services and/or products, to enable you to participate
          in discount, rebate and similar programs in which you may elect to 
          participate. By making a purchase, or engaging in any other kind of 
          activity or transaction that uses financial information, on the 
          Websites, you consent to our providing of your financial information
          to our service providers and to such third parties as we determine are
          necessary to support and process your activities and transactions, as
          well as to your credit card issuer for their purposes. These third
          parties may include the credit card companies and banking institutions
          used to process and support the transaction or activity. By purchasing,
          or registering or making reservations for, products or services of 
          third parties offered on the Websites, or by participating in programs
          offered on the Websites that are administered by third parties and that
          require you to submit financial information in order to use them, you
          also consent to our providing your financial information to those third
          parties. Any of these various third parties may be authorized to use
          your financial information in accordance with our contractual arrange-
          ments with such third parties and in accordance with their own privacy
          policies, over which we have no control, and you agree that we are not
          responsible or liable for any of their actions or omissions. Addition-
          ally, you agree that we may use and disclose all such information so
          submitted to such third parties in the same manner in which we are
          entitled to use and disclose any other information that you submit to us.

          Advertisers. We aggregate (gather up data across all our members' accounts)
          personally identifiable information and disclose such information in a
          non-personally identifiable manner to advertisers and other third parties
          for other marketing and promotional purposes. However, in these situa-
          tions, we do not disclose to these entities any information that could 
          be used to identify you personally. Certain information, such as your 
          name, email address, password, credit card number and bank account
          number, are never disclosed to marketing advertisers. We may use third-
          party advertising companies to serve ads on our behalf. These companies
          may employ cookies and action tags (also known as single pixel gifs or
          web beacons) to measure advertising effectiveness. Any information that
          these third parties collect via cookies and action tags is completely 
          anonymous.

          External Service Providers. There may be a number of services offered by
          external service providers that help you use our Websites. If you choose
          to use these optional services, and in the course of doing so, disclose
          information to the external service providers, and/or grant them permis-
          sion to collect information about you, then their use of your information
          is governed by their private policy.

          Other Corporate Entities. We share much of our data, including personally
          identifiable information about you, with our parent, affiliates, subsidi-
          aries and joint ventures that are committed to serving your online
          needs and related services, throughout the world. To the extent that
          these entities have access to your information, they will treat it at
          least as protectively as they treat information they obtain from their
          other members. Our parent, affiliates, subsidiaries and joint ventures
          will follow privacy practices no less protective of all members than our
          practices described in this document, to the extent allowed by applicable
          law. It is possible that MatchNet, its subsidiaries, joint ventures, or
          any combination of such, could merge with or be acquired by another busi-
          ness entity. Should such a combination occur, you should expect that
          APC, Inc. would share some or all of your information in order to continue
          to provide the service. You will receive notice of such event (to the
          extent it occurs) and we will require that the new combined entity follow
          the practices disclosed in this Privacy Policy.

          Legal Requests. APC, Inc. cooperates with law enforcement inquiries, as well
          as other third parties to enforce laws, such as: intellectual property 
          rights, fraud and other rights. We can (and you authorize us to) disclose
          any information about you to law enforcement and other government officials
          as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate, in con-
          nection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements,
          or other activity that is illegal or may expose us or you to legal liability.
               
     5. Your Use of other Members Information.
          Our services also include access to instant messaging and chat rooms. As a
          member you have access to the Members ID No., and you might gain access to
          other contact information of the Member(s) through the regular use of the
          instant messaging and chat rooms. By accepting this Privacy Policy, you agree
          that, with respect to other Members' personally identifiable information that
          you obtain through instant messaging communication, the chat rooms and email,
          MatchNet hereby grants to you a license to use such information only for: 
         (a) MatchNet related communications that are not unsolicited commercial 
             messages, and 
         (b) any other purpose that such member expressly agrees to after adequate
             disclosure of the purpose(s). In all cases, you must give Members an
             opportunity to remove themselves from your database and a chance to
             review what information you have collected about them. 
             In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this Section,
             can you disclose personally identifiable information about another member
             to a third party without our consent and the consent of such other member
             after adequate disclosure. MatchNet and our members do not tolerate spam.
             Therefore, without limiting the foregoing, you are not licensed to add a
             NiceorSpice member, to your mail list (email or physical mail) without 
             their express written consent after adequate disclosure. To report spam 
             from other NiceorSpice members, please Contact Us.
       
     6. Accessing, Reviewing and Changing Your Profile.
          Following registration, you can review and change the information you 
          submitted during registration through the Member Service Menu including: 
          Your password and e-mail address. If you change your password and email we
          keep track of your old password and email. You can also change your regist-
          ration information such as: name, address, city, state, zip code, country,
          phone number, profile, likes and dislikes, desired date profile, essays and
          saves search criteria.  Upon your written request, we will suspend your
          membership, contact information, and financial information from our active
          databases. Such information will be suspended as soon as reasonably possible
          in accordance with our suspension policy and applicable law.

          We will retain our files information you have requested to remove in order
          in some circumstances, such as to resolve disputes, troubleshoot problems
          and enforce our terms and conditions. Further, such prior information is
          never completely removed from our databases due to technical and legal
          constraints, including stored 'back up' systems. Therefore, you should not
          expect that all of your personally identifiable information will be comp-
          letely removed from our databases in response to your requests.
       
     7. Control of Your Password
          You are responsible for all actions taken with your member ID No. and pass-
          word, including fees. Therefore we do not recommend that you disclose your
          NiceorSpice password or member ID No. to any third parties. If you choose
          to share your member ID No and password or your information with third
          parties to provide you additional services, you are responsible for all
          actions taken with your member ID No. and password and therefore should
          review that third party's privacy policy. If you lose control of your 
          password, you may lose substantial control over your personally identi-
          fiable information and may be subject to legally binding actions taken 
          on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any
          reason, you should immediately change your password.
   
     8. Other Information Collectors
          Except as otherwise expressly included in this Privacy Policy, this
          document only addresses the use and disclosure of information we collect
          from you. To the extent that you disclose your information to other parties,
          whether they are on our Websites or on other sites throughout the Internet,
          different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the information you
          disclose to them. To the extent that we use third party advertisers, they
          adhere to their own privacy policies. Since NiceorSpice does not control the
          privacy policies of the third parties, you are subject to ask questions
          before you disclose your personal information to others.

     9. Security
          NiceorSpice uses industry standard practices to safeguard the confident-
          iality of your personal identifiable information, including &quot;firewalls&quot; 
          and Secure Socket Layers. NiceorSpice treats data as an asset that must
          be protected against loss and unauthorized access. We employ many 
          different security techniques to protect such data from unauthorized 
          access by members inside and outside the company. However, &quot;perfect 
          security&quot; does not exist on the Internet.

    10. Notice
          We may change this Privacy Policy from time to time based on your comments
          and our need to accurately reflect our data collection and disclosure 
          practices. All changes to this policy are effective after we provide you
          with at least (30) days' notice of changes by sending email to members. 
          We provide you with (30) days' notice to allow you the opportunity to 
          notify NiceorSpice if you do not agree to such changes.
