        Service to distribute or up load any virus, trojan horses or do anything else that might cause harm
        to the Service, NiceorSpice systems or to other members' systems in any way. h. you will not post or 
        transmit in any manner any contact information including, but not limited to, email addresses, 
       &quot;instant messenger&quot; nicknames, telephone numbers, postal addresses, URLs, or full names through
        your publicly posted information.

        Membership Categories
               
        Users of the Service may become &quot;Guests&quot;, &quot;Free Members&quot; or &quot;Full Members&quot; of the Service.
        Guests are allowed access to a minimal level of the Service's features and are not charged by us
        for the use of the features they can access. Free Members are allowed to access more features of
        the Service than are Guests, but are not allowed access to all of the features that Full Members
        are allowed to access. Free Members are not charged by us for the features they can access. Full
        Members are provided with access to additional features of the Service that are not available to
        Guests or Free Members. Full Members are not charged by us for the features that are free to
        Free Members. Certain additional features of the Service made available to Full Members are
        also free of charge. Certain other features of the Service are &quot;paid features&quot;, for which a Full
        Member is charged.
       
        Fees and Payments
            
        a. Full Members of the Service are required to purchase &quot;Credits&quot; in order to use the &quot;paid 
            features&quot; of the Service. Each Full Member is credited with the number of Credits purchased.
            Each of the &quot;paid features&quot; of the Service costs one or more Credits to use. Each time a Full
            Member uses a &quot;paid feature&quot; of the Service, his account of Credits is debited by the number
            of Credits charged to use that &quot;paid feature&quot;. 
        b. In order to purchase Credits, Full Members may charge them online to a credit card account,
             place an order via a 1-900 telephone number, pay cash or by credit card in accordance with
             our pricing policy for Credits as posted on the Service from time to time. In addition to 
             paying the published price for Credits, the purchaser is responsible for paying all applicable
             taxes in connection with the purchase of the Credits. We reserve the right to change our 
             pricing policy at any time at our sole discretion. We also reserve the right to change the 
             method or manner in which we charge members for Credits, or the method of payment 
             which is acceptable to us, at our sole discretion. 
         c. Once we have confirmed receipt of your payment, we will credit your account with the
             number of Credits purchased. Where we receive payment for an incorrect amount or 
             non-US$ we will credit your account with a pro-rated number of credits based on the funds
             received, converted to US$ at a reasonable market exchange rate at the time of processing.
             Credits will be automatically deducted from your account as you use &quot;paid features&quot; of the
             Service. You can confirm the number of Credits which remain available to you in your 
             account at any time by checking your account online. A Full Member whose account of 
             Credits is reduced to zero remains a Full Member, but can not access &quot;paid features&quot; until
              additional Credits are purchased. If your usage of the Service is terminated because of a 
              breach of this Agreement or if it is terminated for any reason, any unused Credits are 
              automatically and immediately forfeited. 
          d. THE PURCHASE OF CREDITS IS NON-REFUNDABLE. Any unused Credits will remain
              credited to your account but will not be refunded if unused, even if you are no longer 
              using the Service. Credits will only be credited to the account of the Full Member 
              purchasing the Credits, and to no one else. Credits may not be transferred from one
              member of the Service to another member. The cost of Credits purchased by a Full 
              Member is not refundable under any circumstance but can be used by you at any time. 
          e. You agree to pay or have paid all fees and charges incurred in connection with your 
              membership  with the Service (including any applicable taxes) at the rates in effect 
              when the charges were incurred. All fees and charges are nonrefundable. We may 
              change the fees and charges in effect for using the Service, or add new fees or charges,
              by posting new fees and changes on the site from time to time. You also are responsible
              for any fees or charges incurred to access the Service through an Internet access provider
              or other third party service, including but not limited to telephone charges. YOU, AND 
              NOT WE, ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING ANY AMOUNTS BILLED TO YOUR CREDIT
              CARD BY A THIRD PARTY, WHICH WERE NOT AUTHORIZED BY YOU. 
      
     Privacy and Use of Information
   
     By issuing the services you have also agreed to our Privacy Statement. You acknowledge that 
     (a) we cannot ensure the security or privacy of information you provide through the Internet and
     your email messages, and you release us from any and all liability in connection with the use of
     such information by other parties; (b) we are not responsible for, and cannot control, the use by
     others of any information which you provide to them and you should use caution in selecting the
     personal information you provide to others through the Service; and (c) we cannot assume any
     responsibility for the content of messages sent by other users of the Service, and you release us
     from any and all liability in connection with the contents of any communications you may receive
     from other users. We cannot guarantee, and assume no responsibility for verifying, the accuracy
     of the information provided by other users of the Service.
   
     You may not use the Service for any unlawful purpose. We may refuse to grant you an ID or 
     nickname that impersonates someone else, is protected by trade-mark or proprietary law, or is 
     vulgar or otherwise offensive, as determined by us in our sole discretion.

     Monitoring of Information
 
     We reserve the right to monitor all advertisements, public postings, messages, video and audio
     recordings to ensure that they conform to the content guidelines which may be applicable from
     time to time.

     Removal of Information
 
     While we do not and cannot review every message or other material posted or sent by users of
     the Service, and are not responsible for any content of these messages or materials, we reserve
     the right, but are not obligated, to delete, move, or edit messages or materials, including without
     limitation profiles, public postings, messages, video and audio recordings that we, in our sole
     discretion, deem to violate the Code of Conduct set out above or any applicable content guidelines,
     or to be otherwise unacceptable. You shall remain solely responsible for the content of profiles, 
     public postings, messages, video and audio recordings and other materials you may upload to the
     Service or users of the Service.
   
     Termination of Access to Service
   
     We may, in our sole discretion, terminate or suspend your access to all or part of the Service at
     any time, with or without notice, for any reason, including, without limitation, breach of this
     Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, any fraudulent, abusive, or 
     otherwise illegal activity, or that may otherwise affect the enjoyment of the Service or the 
     Internet by others may be grounds for termination of your access to all or part of the Service
     at our sole discretion, and you may be referred to appropriate law enforcement agencies.

     The Service contains information which is proprietary to us our partners, and our users. We
